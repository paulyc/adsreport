# adsreport - generic reporter for ADS-B data

Intended to replace a wide variety of ADS-B reporting applications
for a wide variety of receivers and data aggregators, which all have
varying levels of openness in terms of hardware, data provided, and
reporting software itself, which leaves you SOL when you want to report
the data you collected with the receiver someone sold you for $9 but
rather than providing the source code there are only ARM64/Linux and 
AMD64/Windows binaries and all you have is AMD64/Linux. Too bad, so sad.

This project aims to remedy these types of silly problems considering
it all started off in the same data format "on the wire" so it is rather 
mysterious to me why everyone didn't just leave it in the same format 
on other wires! something something, vendor lockin, something something.
